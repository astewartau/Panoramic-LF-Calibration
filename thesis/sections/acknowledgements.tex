\section*{Acknowledgements}
I would first like to express my sincere gratitude to my thesis supervisor Dr Donald Dansereau of the Science and Engineering Faculty at QUT, for his continual support, patience, enthusiasm and vast knowledge. He is always passionately reactive to my ceaseless volleys of questions, even when overseas. Thank you for being an excellent supervisor.

Second, I would like to thank Steven Martin, and acknowledge his essential contributions to the project, without which we would not be able to produce any results. Steven assisted immensely by organising the delivery of components, materials and designs.

Last but not least, I would like to express my very profound gratitude to my family and my fianc√©e, who have given me unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study. Thank you. This accomplishment would not have been possible without you.
